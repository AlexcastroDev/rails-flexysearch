# Introduction

The mission here is simple. This is my first implementation of something in RoR.

In the company i work, we have some endpoints that i want to paginate.

In the RFC, i want to implement pagination and filtering.

Today the filtering is done by the frontend, but i want to move it to the backend.

The clientside project is Called Flexyseach: https://github.com/AlexcastroDev/flexysearch

The paginate and filter should be done by Active Record Interface, and should be use easy to use in every controller.
